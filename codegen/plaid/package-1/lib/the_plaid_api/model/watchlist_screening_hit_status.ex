defmodule ThePlaidAPI.Model.WatchlistScreeningHitStatus do
  @moduledoc """
  The current state of review. All watchlist screening hits begin in a `pending_review` state but can be changed by creating a review. When a hit is in the `pending_review` state, it will always show the latest version of the watchlist data Plaid has available and be compared against the latest customer information saved in the watchlist screening. Once a hit has been marked as `confirmed` or `dismissed` it will no longer be updated so that the state is as it was when the review was first conducted.
